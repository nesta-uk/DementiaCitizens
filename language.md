**App:** each research study is run through its own Dementia Citizens app which people download on their phone or tablet. Depending on people's eligibility, they can still use the app even if they don't take part in the research.

**Carer:** the main carer for the person with dementia. In the Dementia Citizens launch this refers to informal settings, so this might be someone's husband, wife, partner, or close family member.

**Person with dementia:** the term we use to describe the individual with memory difficulties who will benefit from using the app.

**Researcher portal:** the website through which research teams can view and download data from the research study apps.

**Research study:** the app activity together with its method of data collection. A research study is run by a research team.

**Research team:** the group who have developed the app activity and method of data collection, and who will analyse the results of the research study.

**Session:** a contained period of time during which the person with dementia and carer use the app.

# <span id="content">Content</span> #

- Information is presented in simple and specific terms.
- Sentences are short.
- Sentences focus on just one message, with no unnecessary words.
- Messages are direct, with no abstract sentences or ideas.
- Questions are framed to refer to specific reference points, rather than being open-ended or demanding free recall.
- Paragraphs make sense on their own. People don't have to remember what was in the first paragraph in order to understand the last one.
- Communication happens on the terms of the person with dementia, so that it's not rushed but instead delivered at their own pace.

<br />

# <span id="formatting">Formatting</span> #

- Bullet points, titles and headings are used to separate information.
- Information is broken down into small chunks, presenting one single idea at a time (i.e. one idea per screen).
- Bigger type is used to be easier to read. The smallest font size advised is 12pt, with 14pt ideal.
- Italics are avoided, as this is more difficult to read.
- White space around the text helps legibility. Too many words on the screen can be overwhelming.

<br />

# <span id="tone">Tone of voice</span> #

- Tone of voice is positive, respectful and empowering.
- It is simple, warm and approachable without being patronising.
- It is inclusive, and can address both a person with dementia and their carer together.
- Language is active, rather than passive.

<br />

# <span id="sensitive-language">Sensitive language</span> #

- Jargon is avoided.
- Focus on the abilities, and not the deficits of people with dementia.
- The word 'dementia' can sometimes evoke negative connotations, but can be used if done in a thoughtful and sensitive context.
